# Pong Game

Welcome to the Pong Game project, a classic Pong game implemented using Python's Tkinter library and Object-Oriented Programming principles. In this version, there is a right paddle operated by AI and a left paddle operated by the user. The game follows a points system to determine the winner.

## Overview

Pong is a two-player game where each player controls a paddle by moving it vertically across the screen. The objective is to hit the ball back and forth between the paddles without letting it pass. The player who misses the ball loses a point, and the game continues until a predefined number of points is reached.

## Features

- Utilizes Tkinter for the graphical user interface.
- Implements Object-Oriented Programming for code organization.
- Features both an AI-operated right paddle and a user-operated left paddle.
- Includes a points system to determine the winner.
